<h1>{{ "where teenagers start ...<em>to learn Java</em>" }}</h1>
    </div>
    <p>This website was set up in order to teach Nigerian teenagers Java, starting from SS1 
(Senior Secondary 1).</p>
   <p>To introduce young Nigerians to Java, we use <strong>"A Peek into 
     Java for Nigerian Teenagers"</strong>, a book that was recently approved by the Lagos State Ministry of Education, 
     for use in senior secondary schools. The author of this
      book, Anthony Okechukwu Ubah, also happens to be the owner of this blog. </p>
    <p>In other words, this website was created in order to help the author of 
"A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers", provide further explanation for the contents of his book. The objective here is 
      to help interested teachers and pupils overcome the initial obstacle posed by the jargon of computer programming.</p>
