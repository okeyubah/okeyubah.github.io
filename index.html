<h1>{{ "where teenagers start ...<em>to learn Java</em>" }}</h1>
    </div>
    <p>This website was set up in order to teach Nigerian teenagers Java, starting from SS1 
(Senior Secondary 1).</p>
   <p>To teach Java, we use <strong>"A Peek into 
     Java for Nigerian Teenagers"</strong>, a book that was recently approved by the Lagos State Ministry of Education, 
     for use in senior secondary schools. The author of that
      book, Anthony Okechukwu Ubah, also happens to be the owner of this blog.</p>
    <p>In short, this website was created in order to help Nigerian teenagers break down, and better comprehend the 
      contents of the above-mentioned book.</p> 
    <p>The objective here is to help interested pupils overcome the initial obstacle that is posed by the esoteric nature of the 
      language of computer programmers. In fact, the need to learn this kind of jargon is the reason why our teenagers are now  
      urgently required to add this subject to their curriculum. The aim is to get young Nigerians to start early to learn 
   how to write computer programs, in order to help quicken the pace of the country's much desired digital transformation.</p>
