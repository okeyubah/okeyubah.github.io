<h1>{{ "Start learning Java at age 14" }}</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to teach Nigerian children Java, starting from SS1 
(Senior Secondary 1). To this end, we have tried very hard to keep our English simple.</p>
   <p>To introduce young Nigerians to Java, we will be using <strong>"A Peek into 
     Java for Nigerian Teenagers"</strong>, a book that the Lagos State Ministry of Education 
     recently approved for use in senior secondary schools. The author of that
      book, Anthony Okechukwu Ubah, also happens to be the owner of this blog. </p>
    <p>In other words, this website was set up to help the author of 
"A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers" explain the contents of his book, for the benefit of 
      interested teachers and pupils.</p>
    <p>To start learning Java, click the <strong>Staff</strong> link at the top of this page
    Then select a writer to read their posts</p>
