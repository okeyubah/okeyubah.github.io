<h1>{{ "Start learning Java at age 14" }}</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to teach Nigerian children Java, starting from SS1 
(Senior Secondary 1). To this end, we have made a conscious effort to ensure that our 
      English is simple and concise.</p>
   <p>To introduce young Nigerians to Java, we will be using a book that the Lagos 
State Ministry of Education recently approved for use in senior secondary schools. That 
     book, <strong>"A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers."</strong> The author of that
      book, Anthony Okechukwu Ubah, also happens to be the owner of this blog. </p>
    <p>In other words, this website was set up in order to help the author of 
"A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers" explain the contents of his book to interested 
    Nigerian teachers and pupils.</p>
