<h1>{{ "where teenagers start ...<em>to learn Java</em>" }}</h1>
    </div>
    <p>This website was set up in order to teach Nigerian teenagers Java, starting from SS1 
(Senior Secondary 1).</p>
   <p>To introduce young Nigerians to Java, we use <strong>"A Peek into 
     Java for Nigerian Teenagers"</strong>, a book that was recently approved by the Lagos State Ministry of Education, 
     for use in senior secondary schools. The author of this
      book, Anthony Okechukwu Ubah, also happens to be the owner of this blog.</p>
    <p>Put differently, this website was created in order to help the author of 
"A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers" explain the contents of his book to as many teenagers as possible.</p> 
    <p>The objective here is to help interested pupils overcome the initial obstacle posed by the kind of 
      jargon employed by computer programmers. We are convinced that by starting early, our teenagers 
      stand a better chance of mastering the kind of language that is often referred to as code.</p>
