- Hi, this is @okeyubah. Full name: Anthony Okechukwu Ubah.
- My website is focused on teaching teenagers Java.
- To do this, I use **"A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers"**
- This book was written by me, and is approved for teaching Java in Lagos state senior secondary schools.
- I am currently learning GraphQL, ReactJS, AngularJS, among others.
- In conjunction with interested collaborators, I would like to develop an app that teaches Java.
