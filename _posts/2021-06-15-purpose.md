The purpose of this website is to teach Nigerian children Java, starting from SS1 
(Senior Secondary 1). To this end, we have tried to make our English as simple as 
practicable. Also, our examples feature familiar Nigerian short names like Tunde, Ada 
and Musa. To introduce young Nigerians to Java, we will be using a book that was recently 
approved by the Lagos State Ministry of Education for senior secondary schools. That book, 
"A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers", was written by Anthony Okechukwu Ubah, 
the owner of this blog. Simply put, this website was established to help the author 
explain the contents of his book to Nigeria teachers and pupils alike.
