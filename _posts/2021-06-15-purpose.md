The purpose of this website is to teach Nigerian children Java, starting from SS1 
(Senior Secondary 1). To this end, we have tried to make our English as simple as 
practicable. Also, our examples feature familiar Nigerian names like Tunde, Ada 
and Musa. 

To introduce young Nigerians to Java, we will be using a book that the Lagos 
State Ministry of Education recently approved for use in senior secondary schools. That 
book, "A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers", was written by Anthony Okechukwu Ubah,  
the owner of this blog. Simply put, this website was established to help the author of 
"A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers" explain the contents of his book to interested 
Nigerian teachers and pupils.
