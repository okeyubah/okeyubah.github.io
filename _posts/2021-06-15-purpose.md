The purpose of this website is to teach Nigerian children Java, starting from SS1 
(Senior Secondary 1). To introduce young Nigerians to Java, we will be using a book that 
the Lagos State Ministry of Education recently approved for use in senior secondary schools. 
That book, "A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers", was written by Anthony Okechukwu Ubah,  
the owner of this blog. Simply put, this website was established to help the author of 
"A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers" explain the contents of his book to interested 
teachers and pupils.
