The purpose of this website is to bring an introduction to Java Programming to the doorsteps
of Nigerian children, starting from SS1 (Senior Secondary 1). To this end, we have tried to make
our English as simple as practicable. In addition, our ecosystem will feature familiar Nigerian 
short names such as Tunde, Ada and Musa.

To bring Java to young Nigerians, we will be using a book that has recently been approved by the
Lagos State Ministry of Education for the teaching of in secondary schools. That book, "A Peek into
Java for Nigerian Teenagers", was written by Anthony Okechukwu, the owner of this blog. To put it 
simply, this website was set up in order to help explain the contents of this book to teachers and
pupils alike.
