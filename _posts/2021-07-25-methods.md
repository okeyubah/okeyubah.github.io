Page 67 - Methods of the String class

First, a look at the two methods of the Student class:

```
public class Student {

  int age;
  
  void setAge(int newAge) {
    age = newAge; 
  }
  
  int getAge() {
    return age; 
  } 
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Student uche = new Student(); 
    uche.setAge(14); 
    int info = uche.getAge();
    System.out.println(info);         // 14
  } 
}

```
In the main() method, we create an object of the Student class.
A reference to this object is stored in 'uche', an object reference. 
We will be using Student methods on this object reference. When we do that, we 
say that we are calling the methods on the object reference. Here is an example:

```
uche.setAge(14);

```
Here, we are invoking setAge(), a method of the Student class. We are calling this 
method on uche, an object reference. The setAge() method takes one argument. The type 
of this argument is int. The compiler will not accept your code if you fail to provide 
this argument or if you provide an argument of the wrong type. The compiler will accept 
our code because we provided one argument, as required. Also, the argument we provided 
(14) happens to be of the type required.
