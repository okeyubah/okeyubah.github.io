An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.
Apple trees are cultivate worldwide, and are the most widely grown
species in genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where
its wild ancester, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have
been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought
to North America by European colonists.
