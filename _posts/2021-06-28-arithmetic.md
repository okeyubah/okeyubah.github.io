Page 57 - Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are probably the easiest thing to understand for newcomers to Java.
It is just the usual "2 + 2 = 4", and other similar familiar computations. This is the 
kind of arithmetic we started to learn the moment we stepped into a primary school:

1. --- 2 + 5 = 7
2. --- 2 * 3 = 6
3. --- 8 - 3 = 5
4. --- 9 / 3 = 3

The arithmetic operators shown above are 1) the plus sign as addition operator, 2)
the asterisk sign as multiplication operator, 3) the hyphen as subtraction operator, 
4) the forward slash as division operator.
