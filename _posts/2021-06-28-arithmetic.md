Page 57 - Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are probably the easiest thing to understand for newcomers to Java.
It is just the usual "2 + 2 = 4", and other similar familiar computations. This is the 
kind of arithmetic we started to learn the moment we stepped into a primary school:

1. --- 2 + 5
2. --- 2 * 3
3. --- 8 - 3 
4. --- 9 / 3 

The arithmetic operators shown above are 1) the plus sign as addition operator, 2)
the asterisk sign as multiplication operator, 3) the hyphen as subtraction operator, 
and 4) the forward slash as division operator.

But wait a minute, one operator is missing, as any Java programmer will tell you. It has 
to do with the remainder, after a division operation. It is called the modulus operator, 
as shown below:

7 % 3 

The above operation is not trying to find out how many times 3 goes into 7. Rather, the 
modulus operation above is concerned with the remainder after you try to divide 7 by 3.
The answer is 1, since 7 divided by 3 leaves us with 1 as remainder. Remember that the only
question we want answered here is "What is the remainder after the division operation?" Try 
the same operation, this time using 6 instead of 7, as shown below:

6 % 3 

What is the result of this operation?
