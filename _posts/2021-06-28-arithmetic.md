Page 57 - Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are probably the easiest thing to understand for newcomers to Java.
It is just the usual "2 + 2 = 4", and other similar familiar computations. This is the 
kind of arithmetic we started to learn the moment we stepped into a primary school, or 
even earlier:

> 2 + 5 = 7<br>
> 2 * 3 = 6<br>
> 8 - 3 = 5<br>
> 9 / 3 = 3<br>
