When you start writing Java code, the first thing you should do is to define a class.
Thereafter, you can then create objects that belong to your new class. After you have created
an object, you can then use that object to accomplish some tasks. Confused?

Not to worry! We will only be looking at how to define classes at this stage. To define a class, 
you write code that starts with the word "class", followed by the name of the class, for example 
class Teacher. Next, you will provide your new class with a pair of curly braces "{}", as shown in 
this example: class Teacher {}.

Now you have a class called Teacher. Notice that the name of the class starts with a capital letter.
The name of any class you define should also start with a capital letter.

Unfortunately, there is nothing within the curly braces, "{ }" of our new class. This means that 
our new class is empty, which also means that our new class is totally useless. To be useful, our
new class should have any number of "members". These members could be data, like the teacher's age or
"methods" which help us to manipulate such data. Thus, a new, more useful definition could look
like this:

class Teacher { <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int age;<br> }

The new definition of the Teacher class contains a member called age. The type of this member is
int. We know that this is the case because the word "age" is preceded by the word "int". Java is
notoriously strict about the type of data you use in your programs.Thus the need to put the word
int in front of age. That way, everyone can see that the piece of data called age is of a
particular type. That type is none other than int, a kind of number. 

Java has other types of data, like "String", which we could use to hold the teacher's name. Thus, if 
we wanted the teacher's age to be replaced by their name, then our definition of the Teacher class 
would look like this: 

class Teacher { <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;String name;<br> }

Notice that the word int has now been replaced by String. This is because the type of name is String, not int.
