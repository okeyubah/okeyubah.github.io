When you start writing Java code, the first thing you should do is to define a class.
Thereafter, you can then create objects that belong to your new class. After you have created
an object, you can use it to do some work.

Not to worry, we will only be looking at how to define classes at this stage.To define a class, 
you write code that starts with the word "class", followed by the name of the class, for example 
class Teacher. Next, you will provide your new class with a pair of curly braces "{}", as shown in 
this example: class Teacher {}.

Now you have a class called Teacher. Notice that the name of the class starts with a capital letter.
The name of any class you define should also start with a capital letter.

Unfortunately, there is nothing within the curly braces, "{ }" of our new class. This means that 
our new class is empty, which also means that our new class is totally useless. To be useful, our
new class should have any number of "members". These members could be data, like the teacher's age or
"methods" which help us to manipulate such data. Thus, a new, more useful definition could look
like this:

class Teacher { <br>int age;<br> }

The new definition of the Teacher class contains a member called age. The type of this member is
int. How do we know that age is an int? Because the word "age" is preceded by the word "int". Java
has other types of data, including one that is called "String". If the type of age was String, rather than
int, then we would have written "String age", rather than "int age".
