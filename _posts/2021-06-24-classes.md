When you start writing Java code, the first thing you should do is to define a class.
Thereafter, you can then create objects that belong to your new class. After you have created
an object, you can use it do some work.

Not to worry, we will only be looking at how to define classes at this stage.To define a class, 
you write code that starts with the word "class", followed by the name of the class, for example 
class Teacher. Next, you will provide your new class with a pair of curly braces "{}", like 
this: class Teacher {}.

Now you have a class called Teacher. Notice that the name of the class starts with a capital letter.
The name of any class you define should also start with a capital letter.

Unfortunately, there is nothing within the curly braces, "{ }" of our new class. This means that 
our new class is empty, which also makes it totally useless.
