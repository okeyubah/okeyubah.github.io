title: Java Identifiers

In order to understand the meaning of identifiers in Java, you should imagine for 
a second that you have suddenly been asked to write a little drama for Nollywood.
To carry out this assignment, you will need to think up names for all the actors in
your little screenplay.

As a programmer you are similarly required to invent names for classes, objects, and other
placeholders for data in your programs. Identifiers are the names that you come up
with for all the classes, members, objects, etc in your Java programs.

A few ground rules apply here, and you will do well to become familiar with them. To
start with, Java is case-sensitive. What this means is that, if you write "Eba" in 
your source file, instead of "eba", the compiler will reject your code. As far as 
the compiler is concerned, the two identifiers ("Eba" and "eba") have absolutly nothing 
in common.

The next thing to remember is that some identifiers have already been taken up by the Java 
programming language. For example, the word "public" has already been taken up by Java, and 
you are not allowed to use it as an identifier in your program. It is rather like telling 
the football administrators in England that you want to register a new football club called 
"Arsenal". You will be politely reminded that the name "Arsenal" has already been taken."

Which names have already been taken by Java? The list is a long one, and includes words like 
java, false, double, long, byte and true. Also included in this list are other words like float, 
boolean, return, class and final. You will either have to learn them all, one by one, or wait for the compiler 
to reject each identifier one by one, as you compile your list of "banned" or "forbidden" words.
