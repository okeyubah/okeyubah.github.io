In order to understand the meaning of identifiers in Java, you should take a step
backwards, and imagine that you are required to write a little drama for Nollywood.
To carry out this function, you will need to think up names for all the actors in
your little screenplay.

As a programmer you are similarly required to invent names for classes, objects, other
placeholders for data in your programs. Identifiers are he names that your fecond 
imagination must conjur up to populate your Java programs.

A few ground rules apply here, and you will do well to become familiar with them. To
start with, Java is case-sensitive. What this means is that, if you make the mistake of 
writing "Eba" in your source code instead of "eba", your program will experience grave
difficulties. As far as the compiler is concerned, "Eba" and "eba" have absolutely nothing 
in common.
