In order to understand the meaning of identifiers in Java, you should imagine for 
a second that you have suddenly been asked to write a little drama for Nollywood.
To carry out this function, you will need to think up names for all the actors in
your little screenplay.

As a programmer you are similarly required to invent names for classes, objects, and other
placeholders for data in your programs. Identifiers are the names that you come up
with for all the classes, members, objects, etc in your Java programs.

A few ground rules apply here, and you will do well to become familiar with them. To
start with, Java is case-sensitive. What this means is that, if you provide "Eba" as 
an identifier where "eba" is expected in your source file, the compiler will promptly 
reject your code. As far as the compiler is concerned, the two identifiers ("Eba" and "eba")
have absolutly nothing in common.

The next thing to remember is that some identifiers have already been taken up by the Java 
programming language. For example, the word "public" has already been taken up by Java, and 
you are not allowed to use it as an identifier in your program. It is rather like telling 
the folks in Central Bank that you want to register a new bank called "Zenith Bank". They 
would probably all bark in unison, "Sorry Sir, but that name has already been taken!"

Which names have already been taken by Java? The list is a long one, and includes words like 
java, false, double, long, byte and true. Also included in this list are float, boolean, return, 
class and final. You will either have to learn them all, one by one, or wait for the compiler 
to reject each identifier before adding it to your list of "banned" or "forbidden" words.
