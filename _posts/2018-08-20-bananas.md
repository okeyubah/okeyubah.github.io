A banana is an edible fruit - botanically a berry - produced by several
kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.

In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains", distinguishing
them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is
usually elongated and green, yellow, red, purple or brown when ripe.
