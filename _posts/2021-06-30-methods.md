Page 67 - Methods of the String class

The String class has many uses, but in the book, "A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers", 
the String class has another special use: it helps us demonstrate the role of methods in Java. 

First a recap: we know that a class is a prototype, while an object represents a concrete 
manifestation of that prototype. A building plan for a bungalow could be likened to the definition 
of a class, while the bungalow in which you live (or lived) is actually an object of the Bungalow 
class. We defined the Student class in a previous post. Thereafter, we can create hundreds of 
student objects, with each object containing unique information pertaining to each individual student.

Thus, each student object will have a distinct piece of data called age. We will regard the 
student's age as an instance variable. We call this an instance variable because each instance 
(or object) of the Student class will have its own copy of this variable. In this context, we 
can also call age a member of the Student class. It should be noted, however, that not all 
members of a class are instance variables. For example, methods of a class are members of that 
class, but methods are not instance variables.

What is a method? What are some of the more common methods of the String class?
