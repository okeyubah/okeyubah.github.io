To teach teenagers Java, we rely on a number of tools, including **"A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers"** by Anthony Okechukw Ubah. This same author also happens to be the writer of the current blog. 

The book referred to above is currently the only title that has been approved by the Lagos State Ministry of Education for the teaching of computer programming in secondary schools, starting from SS1. Java also happens to be the only programming language that has been approved to be taught in Lagos State secondary schools. No other state in Nigeria is known to harbour similar ambitions of teaching computer programming in senior secondary schools.

To contact the writer of this blog, and author of "A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers", please call 0803 400 0665, or send an email to okechukwuubah@hotmail.co.uk.
