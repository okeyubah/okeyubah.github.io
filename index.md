### This website was set up to help convince you to get your child to start learning Java from about age 14.

To teach teenagers Java, we rely on a number of tools, including **"A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers."** This book was authored by Anthony Okechukw Ubah, who also happens to be the owner of this blog. 

The above-named title is currently the only book that has been approved by the Lagos State Ministry of Education for the teaching of computer programming in secondary schools, starting from SS1. Java also happens to be the only programming language that has been approved to be taught in Lagos State secondary schools. No other state in Nigeria is known to have similar ambitions of teaching computer programming in secondary schools.
