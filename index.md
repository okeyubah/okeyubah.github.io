### Welcome to Okey's blog, the only website that can teach your child Java from age 14

To teach teenagers Java, we use the book, "A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers" by Anthony Okechukw Ubah, who also happens to be the owner of this website. 

The abovenamed title is currently the only book approved by the Lagos State Ministry of Education for teaching computer programming in secondary schools, starting from SS1. Java is also the only computer programming language that appears in the approved curriculum of Lagos State secondary schools.
