### Welcome to Okey's blog, the website that teaches your child Java from age 14

To teach teenagers Java, we use the book, "A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers" by Anthony Okechukw Ubah, the owner of this website. The aforementioned title is currently the only book that has been approved by the Lagos State Ministry of Education for the teaching of computer programming, starting from SS1. Java is also the only computer programming language that has been approved to be taught in secondary schools within Lagos State.
