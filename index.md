### Welcome to Okey's blog, the only website that teaches your child Java from age 14

To teach teenagers Java, we use the book, **"A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers."** The author, Anthony Okechukw Ubah, also happens to be the owner of this blog. 

The above-named title is currently the only book approved by the Lagos State Ministry of Education for teaching computer programming in secondary schools, starting from SS1. Java is also the only computer programming language that has been approved to be taught in Lagos State secondary schools. No other state in Nigeria teaches computer programming in secondary schools.
