Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the
edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.
The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit is oval, about the size of 
a hen's egg, 5-8 cm (2.0-3.1 in) and 4.5-5.5 cm (1.8-2.2 in) in diameter.
It has a fibrous, dull greenish-brown and bright green or golden flesh
with rows of tine, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft texture,
with a sweet and unique flavour.
