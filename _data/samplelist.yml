feedback: >
  This is my feedback to you.
  Even if I include line breaks here,
  all of the line breaks will be removed when the value is inserted.
block: |
  This pipe does something a little different.
  It preserves the breaks.
  This is really helpful for code samples,
  since you can format the  code samples with
  the appropriate line breaks.
